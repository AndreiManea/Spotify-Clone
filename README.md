# Spotify Clone
<p> Spotify Clone build with <strong> React.js .</strong> </p>
<p> For this project I used <strong>Spotify for Developers </strong> and <strong>spotify-web-api-js . </strong></p>
<p> <strong>Authentification</strong> was done through the redirectUri feature that SfP provided by giving me a token and using that token. </p>
<p> <strong> React Context API </strong> was used in order to better store information that would later be available through all components without prop drilling.</p>
<p> <strong> Material UI </strong> was used for the <strong>Styled Components</strong> it provides ( <strong> icons, Grid, Slider </strong> ). </p>
<p> <strong> Flexbox, CSS </strong> and <strong> BEM </strong> were used for the structuring and styling of the website. </p>
<p> <strong> Deployment </strong> has been done through <strong>FireBase</strong>.</p>
